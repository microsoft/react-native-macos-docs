# Create your first app

This guide will help you get started on setting up your very first React Native for macOS app. Make sure you have [set up your development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to build React Native without a framework.

## 1. `react-native-macos-init`

We can add macOS to an existing app created by the React Native Community cli.

Now, run `pod install` and `run-macos` and you have your first app! Let's add a screenshot here.
