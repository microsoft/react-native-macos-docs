# Introduction

**React Native macOS** is an [out-of-tree platform](https://reactnative.dev/docs/out-of-tree-platforms) maintained by Microsoft that extends React Native to support the macOS Platform. 

React Native macOS works with the React Native ecosystem and adds support for macOS specific feartures. You can reuse your components, libraries, and code across platforms to make development easier. You can also write native macOS components to build truly native desktop apps. 

Whether you are starting a new macOS app, adding desktop support to an existing React Native project, or adding a React Native feature to your existing native macOS app, React Native macOS gives you the tools you need to build great native apps.
